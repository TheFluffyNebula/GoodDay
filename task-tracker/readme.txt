I'm using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8

stuff to download: node.js
terminal: npm i react-icons
to run it: cd into task-tracker folder, then input "npm start" into terminal

React chrome extension, VERY nice for debugging (ex. seeing values of components)
Not showing up? Use this fix:
"HEY all, found a way to fix this issue..click inspect, go into settings , click ignore list, 
under General exclusion rules: uncheck "Content scripts injected by extensions".. 

vsc stuff:
get the ES7+ React extension (some shortcuts)
rafce: new component, clg: console.log
optional: change the language bottom right from JS to JSX
misc: vs code pets! (get the extension, then click the squirrel icon bot right)

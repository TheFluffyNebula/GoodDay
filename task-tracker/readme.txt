I'm using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8

stuff to download: node.js
terminal: npm i react-icons
to run it: cd into task-tracker folder, then input "npm start" into terminal
probably a good idea: react chrome extension, VERY nice for debugging (litearl popup instead of console pain)


vsc stuff:
get the ES7+ React extension (some shortcuts)
change the language bottom right from JS to JSX
misc: vs code pets! (get the extension, then click the squirrel icon bot right)
